	M-x package-install RET xref-union RET

Usage
-----

The easiest way to use the package is to enable the `xref-union-mode`
minor mode, manually or by adding a hook to whatever mode you expect
using the package with

	(add-hook 'foo-bar-mode-hook 'xref-union-mode)

This will merge all the other backends into one.

You can also manually choose what backends to combine, by enumerating
them in an object like:

	'(union some-randomxref-backend etags--xref-backend)

and adding that to `xref-backend-functions`.
